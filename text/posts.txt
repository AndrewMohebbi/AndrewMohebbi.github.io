# Power as Redistribution
& 2020-9-22

1. An{1} important _form_ of power is power as redistribution. That is, the ability to distribute necessary goods, like food, shelter, land, or a currency equivalent. The individual or organized body which redistributes gains power from that redistribution.

2. We say redistribution to emphasize that these goods have been acquired from the producers, and that they are being distributed again in a different manner. As an example, consider how a government taxes its citizens and then spends those same taxes every year, much of it on its citizens. 

3. Giving is better than keeping. We often think about institutions which extract goods from producers as parasites. And they are, but the redistribution is crucial. Because if the goods were instead extravagantly consumed by the institution, no power would result from it. The goods need to be passed on to some sort of dependent, or supporter, or employee. 

4. Other forms of power are power as force, like how someone might have power over you because of a superior weapon. Or power as status, where someone has power over you because they have more authority in a given community. Or power as law, which is the power to make rules, which is not the same as redistribution but is related, since the ability to redistribute goods is often conceptualized as a legal right to do so.

5. Let’s look at an example. A feudal lord extracts produce from peasants. The lord then distributes this to servants, retainers, and soldiers. The ability to extract goods, along with the ability to redistribute those goods, are the powers of the lord. The act of redistribution to a select number of people, always with strings attached, is crucial. It is a reorganization of resources to benefit an individual and his house. 

6. The U.S. government extracts trillions of dollars a year from the U.S. population, and then redistributes it through large bureaucratic mechanisms. A huge chunk of it is given back, in the form of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. A smaller chunk is given to the army, to army contractors, and to military researchers. Hundreds of thousands of bureaucrats are sustained through this tax money, including politicians (but they also take lobby money). Some makes its way to the private sector, in the form of subsidies, government contracts, and bailouts. Every financial crisis sees rivers of opulence flowing from the federal treasury into the treasuries of commercial and investment banks. Even favored foreign states get their share. 

7. Generalizing this, the entire economy is a great mechanism of redistribution. There are people (it seems like less every year) who produce necessary goods, such as food, clothing, housing, medicine. Others, regardless of what they do, whether they are administrators, politicians, teachers, musicians, engineers, shopkeepers, truck drivers- even someone who has nothing but leisure all day- all of these people rely on a system of redistribution to get necessary goods. Society is a giant redistribution network, and the nodes are the points where redistribution is decided. That is, where power is. 

8. This form of power, the ability to redistribute, is in a positive reinforcement loop with power as force. Redistribution is sometimes done in common, or is allowed by the consent of those who produce and otherwise participate in the redistribution. But much of the time it’s simply something imposed, which one has no say in, and which is protected by the actual violence of a police force. But the police rely on that very same redistribution for their income.

9. A smaller example is a corporation. The power they have over people is through wages. Or through bribes. If everything goes correctly, they can then accumulate more wealth through the efforts of their workers, which then gets redistributed either to higher wages, or to more employees, or to shareholders (whose function as investors is almost purely redistributive). Regardless, redistribution is a tool to increase the power of the firm. 

10. The accumulation of wealth is an accumulation of power only because of its potential to be redistributed. The way in which the wealth is distributed can make or break the power of the redistributor. 

11. An even smaller example is in the household. For decades the ideal of the male wage earner has subordinated women living in money economies. Generalizing this across previous economies, the ability to redistribute more wealth to adult males is constitutive of what we call patriarchy. 

12. Redistribution is old. The adults which harvested and cooked shared the children, the old, the disabled, healers and priests, warriors during times of war, and on and on. Many schemes of distribution and redistribution existed, organized through a mix of household, kinship and community, depending on the society. Storage and rationing were important. Certain goods were saved for certain needs, or maybe for certain celebrations. Power and responsibility were in the ability to decide on distribution. In some societies, charismatic leaders collected and then redistributed in feasts, opulent events of consumption. Some societies developed classes of administrators whose job was redistribution, the management of resources; some societies developed leisure classes. But we can’t say “the rest is history,” since it’s been shown by anthropologists that money economies, where money is at the heart of economic distribution, don’t pop-up spontaneously.

# One-Way Holes
& 2020-9-15

1. There is a popular metaphor for DNA which goes like this: DNA is selfish because it tries to increase copies of itself. If it has certain patterns, those patterns might be expressed in some biological way which makes that DNA replicate more often. Other DNA patterns replicate less, so there tends to be less of them, sometimes even onto extinction. This sets up a scene where you have utterly lifeless, material things caught up in this self-reinforcing loop which ends up with the entire planet crawling with DNA. 

If you’re paying attention, you might say that we’re simply taking ethical concepts and using them to anthropomorphize the lifeless matter of DNA. But the more interesting thought is: what if the metaphor is closer to the truth? The way in which DNA, once it exists, seems to point in the direction of growth. What if this basic pattern is an abstract version of the way we experience the world? Then this metaphor would be us recognizing ourselves in a piece of us. When dead matter points in a direction, maybe this is where meaning comes from, the way that animals deeply feel that what they experience has a meaning. That an experience is “about something,” the way that a sound comes from somewhere, or that a sharp pain represents something happening to your body. Or for some animals: that life grows outwards towards a goal. 

2. There’s a Mula Nasrudin story where Nasrudin asks an admirer to make a hole big enough in his fence for his neighbor’s chickens to wander in, but small enough so that they can’t get back. Like most Nasrudin stories, you wonder if there’s knowledge hidden behind the silly absurdity, or if it’s just plain absurd. Or maybe that you’re absurd for thinking that you found knowledge in the silliness. 

It seems like a paradox, but you can construct all sorts of holes that a chicken might wander through but not back. Consider a hole that drops down into your yard, which would make it easy for a chicken to fall through, but difficult to climb back to the other side. Or maybe a hole that’s large and straight on your neighbors side, but small and crooked on your side. A chicken might easily wander through the large side, but once it gets out the other end, maybe it’s difficult to notice the way back in. 

3. Holes like these are actually everywhere. Cells use them to keep things in, and to pump things out. Many different ingenious orifices keep the delicate balance which cells need to survive, a delicately tuned machine.

Bureaucracies also use one-way holes to extract resources from other entities, like a foreign country. The holes are in fact cleverly designed social and legal mechanisms which induce a country’s leadership to continuously divert their country’s product to the foreign bureaucracy. The best example are the IMF loans that countries fail for decades to pay off.

The first case is closer to an actual hole, and the second one is more of an abstraction. Either way, the form is the same. Nasrudin’s one-way holes are a means to extract something, and to keep it in place for your benefit.

4. Sucking is a common one-way hole. When you suck a soda through a straw, you bring it up into your mouth, and down your throat. Gravity will then keep it inside of you, but there is also an elaborate series of sphincters which will make sure the soda doesn’t leave. This same pattern is that of the mosquito which sucks your blood, or the vacuum which sucks water off your floor, or a dehumidifying packet which sucks moisture from your seaweed snack. Thinking about it in this way, sucking is one of the most basic one-way patterns, since it always takes effort to either resist the sucking or reverse the displacement it causes. 

5. Another example of a one-way hole is photosynthesis. Light flies from the sun and strikes the leaf, where a chemical reaction occurs to convert the light into a more physical form of energy. Some light makes it out, including the beautiful green color which is rejected by the process. This allows the plant to organize itself, that is, to grow and be healthy. 

6. Is death a one-way hole? It seems to be portrayed that way in our stories. Like ghosts that haunt for an eternity, unable to resolve their problems because of their immateriality. And you can easily go to heaven or hell, but rarely back. At least this is reflected in the brute facts: once something is dead, it rarely becomes alive again. There is something which makes death irreversible, but what is it?

We also know that one-way holes are often developed by organisms. It’s an extraction tool. Is death an extraction tool? Whose tool is it? And what is being extracted?

7. Time is also a one-way hole. Once you pass through it, you can’t find your way back. We can ask the same question: is something being extracted? And by who? And how paranoid are we?

8. One of the simplest one-way holes are doors that lock. A door might lock on a childhood memory, or it might lock after a traumatic or formative experience. Some of us have never been the same after listening to a certain piece of music. Or being unable to see someone as we once did, after learning something about them. Meaning takes part in the games of doors that only open one way. 

The other side of this is that the meaning making process might have crossed a door that is now locked. There are certain forms of matter which form patterns that seem to point. A part of their strategy is to make doors that open and then lock, which is an arrow pointing in one direction. Does this process now have enough momentum to continue forever?

# Cutting Grass
& 2020-8-21

Workers, dark from the sun, in red uniforms, sweeping the clippings of a perfectly manicured lawn. Two rows of identitical villas, most of them empty, sitting next to a golf course in a resort in Acapulco. I watch from the 3rd floor; the workers don their masks only when they talk to one of the proprieters. The air is thick and humid, it’s summer but only a few villas have cars in front of them. 

The grass is cropped low and thick, like a lover’s crotch, waiting. Who is the grass being cut for?

# Different Definitions of Identity Politics
& 2020-8-10

1. Something that social theorists were using, in the 20th century, to describe how politics played out in the US.

2. A term coined by the Combahee River Collective Statement to describe a certain model of organizing (previously picked up by other social theorists, like in 1.). The idea is that identity provides a viewpoint which becomes crucial for political action.

3. More broadly, the construction of revolutionary subjects, the type of person who will bring about the revolution. You see this in the Combahee statement, but also in feminism and in Marxism. For Marx, the revolutionary subject was the industrial worker.

3.1 This sometimes leads to absurdities, like the usurpers of the Russian revolution claiming that they should sieze power from the workers collectives because Russian workers were too parochial, agricultural, un-industrial to truly lead the revolution. See A Cyborg Manifesto for discussion on the construction of revolutionary subjects. She tries to construct her own subject, the cyborg.

4. A description of a certain kind of discourse, much of which is found on social media. Involves making claims to what can or can’t be said or known depending on ones identity (heritage, race, gender, sexuality).

4.1 This is now part of mainstream US politics, since it has become part of the “culture wars,” maybe the broadest discursive space in US politics. 

5. A way of describing the sorts of interventions that feminists of color make into white feminism, or similar.

# Notes on White Experience
& 2020-8-9

1. My dad has this story which for him summarizes the difference between Iranian and American culture. “My friend Max, who's Iranian, was married to an American woman. They’re divorced now. She would label her food in the refrigerator so that her children wouldn’t eat it.”

2. In an interview with New York squatters (from Midnight Notes’ The New Enclosures), I read the opinion that white cultural life in the US is totally dead, that it has been eviscerated, that it lacks the sort of community life that has been part of the human experience since humans showed up on this earth. The context for this comment was the rampant secularism which has destroyed a popular form of community life: being part of a local church, which other demographics have held on to better.

2.1 This is a broad generalization, church-going is still important for many white communities. Actually, many white curch-going communities often also see themselves in opposition to hegemonic liberalism. Think US Christian conservatism.

2.2 Me and my mother used to go to a local spanish-speaking church every weekend, a predominantly Latin American church in which she made some friends and found some community life. When we moved deeper into the richer suburbs, the only nearby church was an english-speaking one. She felt alienated and stopped going to church.

3. While living in Boston, the only time strangers actually payed attention to me walking down the street and casually greeted me was when I briefly visited a black neighborhood in Roxbury. People were actually spending time on the street rather than rushing by.

4. Capitalism has eviscerated white culture. White workers in Europe, as one of the raw materials for capitalism, had their common lands enclosed, and were forced into wage slavery by capitalists, transforming white community and social life. This destruction of white (and now pretty much every) community has continued through the present, as the modern economy forces an aspirational model of life which holds no bond or locale sacred. We are encouraged to move constantly for our work, jump from city to city, company to company, to live in largely anonymous cities, or completely atomized suburbs.

4.1 Although this model of work is imposed more on white collar workers.

4.2 As mentioned above, resistance to capitalism's evisceration sometimes takes the form of popular conservatisms. Consider country pop music. It has a very concrete language, with a well understood universe of images and metaphors: trucks, dogs, dignified labor. People who listen to country music understand themselves as positioned in a place, a community, with concrete values. By contrast, top 40s radio is often vague, conceptual, the metaphors are more generic. (Although the ascendence of rap in pop music challenges this a little.) 

4.2.1 These two poles of pop music (the hegemonic top 40s vs the alternative country pop music) mirrors liberal vs conservative politics. The liberals see themselves as cosmopolitan, universal; the conservatives understand themselves as located, as part of a specific community. (Although this isn’t true for politicians, who are all lizards.)

4.2.2 Counter to popular forms of resistance to liberal hegemony (e.g. country music, although I’m not trying to say it is predominently a form of resistance) is the liberal hunch that people who participate in it (listen to it) are parochial racists who support sexist, bigoted leaders. But so much of this discourse is handed down to people by the intelligentsia (who conservatives despise). But who’s more on my side? you should ask yourself: the liberal media elites or white working people? (This is not a rhetorical question.)

4.2.2.1 Conservative politicans are eating this up right now: liberals no longer make any pretenses of supporting white working class people. (Bernie might be an exception.)

5. My girlfriend, from Mexico, tells me that the reason we can date is that I am not a typical USonian in that I have and understand the structure of extended family. She also says that my mom, though she is from Spain, is not really white in the US, because of the particular form of whiteness in the US. My mom comes from a farming family, a dignified but working class form of living in mid-century Spain. A large family, she’s the 7th of 13 siblings.

6. For white Americans, culture has been so thoroughly eviscerated by the regime of wage labor that it’s hard to consider anything sacred.

6.1 Possibly this is the reason behind US theories of toxicity, of cancelling, even of gender deconstruction. All of these have complex origins (think: queer communities trying to deal with family members which hurt them; gender based alienation; black social media cancelling predatory celebrities) but it is interesting how strongly these politics have proliferated in the mainstream US. Maybe the utter desolation of white community life is a breeding ground for theories which tell you that you can cut any tie you have with anyone, that you can be anything you want.

6.2 This is also one of the roots of the appeal of US conservatism. Actually, conservatisms seem to pop out of conflicts with exploitative markets. Think the rise of fascism in Great Depression Germany.

6.2.1 Exploitative markets are a root of human expendibility. But we perpetuate it in our private lives.

7. My girlfriend talks about the growing critique in Mexico City politics of radical feminism. She claims it has become the mainstream feminism there, and so we are seeing a repition of what happened in the 80s in the US between radical and “third world” feminists (think Audre Lorde): Mestiza feminists are making an identity political critique of radical feminism, saying that it carries with it all sorts of white-coded ideas. One example is that of cancelling (“scratching”), the idea that you can remove men from your community because they have raped someone. This was common of student feminist groups while she studied at UNAM, and it is something which she and others have grown to be more critical of.

8. This is political fiction. I am speaking in generalities, as if “white US people” is a well defined and homogenous category. White experience is immense and multifaceted. My thoughts fail on so many different white communities. But I’m trying to explain part of white alienation which has been undeniable in my own life.

# Balance of Payment: a Euphemism
& 2020-6-11

When reading about the International Monetary Fund, I keep seeing that they helped countries with their "balance of payment" problems. Jon Williamson, in a lament for the phrase "Washington Consensus,"{1} which he coined, speaks of a "balance of payment crisis," and how dealing with this through "Fiscal Discipline" was ultimately good for a country's poor people. If you can pay attention long enough, it's easy to figure out that "balance of payment problem" just means that a country has run up a large deficit in its accounts. But why were so many countries having this problem? It was usually glossed over.

So I decided to look for the answer on Encyclopedia Britannica's website. This is from an informative article titled "Third World debt":

"" The origins of developing-world debt crisis can be traced to the oil-price shock of 1973–74. At the time, the member states of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) limited the supply of oil, which resulted in a huge increase in its price. That had a significant impact on all importers of oil, including many newly independent countries in Africa. The excess profits that OPEC members received were then invested in the Western commercial banking sector.{2}

It seems like alot of money was flowing into private US banks. What next?

"" The banks then sought to find new borrowers to lend that money to. Developing countries, which were in need of development assistance to soften the impact of increased oil prices, were considered a sensible and safe option by the banks. That meant that during the second half of the 1970s, a significant proportion of the flows of capital to the developing world came from commercial banks. {3}

Ok, so private banks were making large and lucrative loans to these countries. So these are the guys that those countries, the ones with the "balance of payments crisis", owed money too. Well good thing they were private U.S. banks. The international financial system would probably understand if a private bank needed to make a sacrifice in case the country was having a really hard time paying it back.

"" The initial response to the developing-world debt crisis was an approach centred on short-term measures to prevent debt defaults. The IMF and the World Bank provided loans that were conditional on borrowing countries’ following a series of structural adjustment measures. Those were designed to increase the productivity of their economies in the hope that such increases would enable them to resolve their problems.{4}

Oh... so the IMF stepped in to... help... the country not default on a private loan. Well, ok, that's probably good, I guess maybe some creditors are better to deal with than others. But what's this thing about "structural adjustment measures"? The article doesn't have anything else on this, but there is a link to an article titled "Austerity" which might help:

"" During Argentina’s economic crisis in 1998–2002, the country adopted severe austerity measures, largely following the advice of its major creditor, the International Monetary Fund (IMF); they included cuts in government pensions and salaries and in numerous social programs, as well as significant tax increases. In return, the IMF agreed to extend a low-interest loan to the Argentine government to help its ailing economy.{5}

Ok... that doesn't sound too great actually. Maybe I made a mistake following that link. "Austerity" sounds like a loaded word anyways. I'll just search the encyclopedia for "structural adjustment IMF," see what turns up.

"" In the late 1980s Egypt’s economy suffered markedly from falling oil prices and was further weakened by a drop in the number of remittances from its three million workers abroad. In spite of a rising debt burden, the government continued to rely heavily on foreign economic aid, leading to growing interference by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Egypt’s economic policies; in 1991 the Egyptian government signed the Economic Reform and Structural Adjustment Program with the IMF and the World Bank. The country’s currency, the Egyptian pound, had to be devalued several times, interest rates were raised, and subsidies were lowered on food and fuel. These policies especially harmed the poorest Egyptians, who often looked to Islamist groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood for assistance.{6}

Huh.

"" Under pressure from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reverse the growth of government spending, liberalize prices, encourage a more open investment code, and provide incentives to agriculture and forestry, the Central African Republic submitted to a structural adjustment program in 1986.{7}

Government spending, like education and medicine?

"" At first, international agencies such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, as well as Mobutu’s allies in the West, turned a blind eye to his personal appropriation of the economy and the associated declines in productivity and exports. The fall in copper prices in the mid-1970s, however, led to audits of state enterprises that revealed high levels of embezzlement. Nonetheless, Mobutu remained an important Cold War ally for Western countries, and for the next 20 years international financial institutions and his Western allies continued to find ways to keep the sinking economy afloat.{8}

Wha-

"" The economy responded with a relentless decline. Exports fell, inflation rose, and debt was significantly expanded. Debt services took more than half of the country’s export earnings, and imports nearly ceased for lack of foreign exchange. ... Under these adverse conditions the country’s infrastructure and social services deteriorated greatly. The rural population was reduced to subsistence levels, bartering with cattle and bags of paddy. Bankrupt by 1982, the country was forced to adopt a program of structural adjustment imposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and face a humiliating turnabout to re-liberalize the economy. Abolition of the state monopolies was accepted, and any state enterprise that could not pay its way was threatened with privatization.{9}

Oh. Well, thats no fun.
