# Different Definitions of Identity Politics
& 2020-8-10

1. Something that social theorists were using, in the 20th century, to describe how politics played out in the US.

2. A term coined by the Combahee River Collective Statement to describe a certain model of organizing (previously picked up by other social theorists, like in 1.).

3. More broadly, the construction of revolutionary subjects, the type of person who will bring about the revolution. You see this in the Combahee statement, but also in feminism and in Marxism. For Marx, the revolutionary subject was the industrial worker.

3.1 This sometimes leads to absurdities, like the usurpers of the Russian revolution claiming that they should sieze power from the workers collectives because Russian workers were too parochial, agricultural, un-industrial to truly lead the revolution. See A Cyborg Manifesto for discussion on the construction of revolutionary subjects. She tries to construct her own subject, the cyborg.

4. A description of a certain kind of discourse, much of which is found on social media. Involves making claims to what can or can’t be said or known depending on ones identity (heritage, race, gender, sexuality).

4.1 This is now part of mainstream US politics, since it has become part of the “culture wars,” maybe the broadest discursive space in US politics.

# Notes on White Experience
& 2020-8-9

1. My dad has this story which for him summarizes the difference between Iranian and American culture. “My friend Max, who's Iranian, was married to an American woman. They’re divorced now. He would tell me how she would label her food in the refrigerator so that thier children wouldn’t eat it.”

2. In an interview with New York squatters (from Midnight Notes’ The New Enclosures), I read the opinion that white cultural life in the U.S. is totally dead, that it has been eviscerated, that it lacks the sort of community life that has been part of the human experience since humans showed up on this earth. The context for this comment was the rampant secularism which has destroyed a popular form of community life: being part of a local church, which other demographics have held on to better.

2.1 Me and my mother used to go to a local spanish-speaking church every weekend, a predominantly Latin American church in which she made some friends and found some community life. When we moved deeper into the richer suburbs, the only nearby church was an english-speaking one She felt alienated and stopped going to church.

3. While living in Boston, the only time strangers actually payed attention to me walking down the street and casually greeted me was when I briefly visited a black neighborhood in Roxbury. People were actually spending time on the street rather than rushing by.

4. Capitalism has eviscerated white culture. White workers in Europe, as one of the raw materials for capitalism, had their common lands enclosed, and were forced into wage slavery by capitalists, transforming white community and social life. This destruction of white (and now pretty much every) community has continued through the present, as the modern economy forces an aspirational model of life which holds no bond or locale sacred. We are encouraged to move constantly for our work, jump from city to city, company to company, to live in largely anonymous cities, or completely atomized suburbs.

4.1 Although I understand that this model of work is imposed more on white collar workers.

4.2 One form of resistance is popular kinds of conservatism. Consider country pop music. It has a very concrete language, with a well understood universe of images and metaphors: trucks, dogs, dignified labor. People who listen to country music understand themselves as positioned in a place, a community, with concrete values. By contrast, top 40s radio is often vague, conceptual, the metaphors are more generic. (Although the ascendence of rap in pop music challenges this a little.) These two poles of pop music (the hegemonic top 40s vs the alternative country pop music) mirrors liberal vs conservative politics. The liberals see themselves as cosmopolitan, universal; the conservatives understand themselves as located, as part of a specific community. (Although this isn’t true for politicians, who are all lizards.)

4.2.1 Counter to this popular form of white resistance to liberal hegemony (country music, although I’m not trying to say it is predominently a form of resistance) is the liberal hunch that people who participate in it (people that listen to it) are parochial racists who vote for sexist bigots. But so much of this discourse is handed down to people by the intelligentsia (who conservatives despise). But who’s more on my side? you should ask yourself, The liberal media elites or white working people? (This is not a rhetorical question, the answer may very well be the intelligentsia.)

4.2.1.1 Conservative politicans are eating this up right now: liberals no longer make any pretenses of supporting white working class people. (Bernie is an exception.)

5. My girlfriend, from Mexico, tells me that the reason we can date is that I am not a typical USonian in that I have and understand the structure of extended family. She also says that my mom, though she is from Spain, is not really white in the US, because of the particular form of whiteness in the US (which is maybe the hegemonic whiteness?). My mom comes from a farming family, a dignified but working class form of living in mid-century Spain. A large family, she’s the 7th of 13 siblings.

6. For white Americans, culture has been so thoroughly eviscerated by the regime of wage labor that it’s hard to consider anything sacred.

6.1 Possibly this is the reason behind US theories of toxicity, of cancelling, even of gender experimentation. All of these have complex origins (think: queer communities trying to deal with family members which hurt them; gender based alienation; black social media cancelling predatory celebrities) but it is interesting how strongly these politics have proliferated in the mainstream. Maybe the utter desolation of white community life is a breeding ground for theories which tell you that you can cut any tie you have with anyone, that you can be anything you want.

6.1.1 Not trying to say gender deconstruction is not valid, I'm all for it.

6.2 This is also one of the roots of the appeal of US conservatism. Actually, conservatisms seem to pop out of conflicts with exploitative markets. Think the rise of fascism in Great Depression Germany.

6.2.1 Exploitative markets are the root of human expendibility. We just perpetuate it in our private lives.

7. My girlfriend is talking about the growing critique in Mexico City politics of radical feminism. She claims it has become the mainstream feminism there, and so we are seeing a repition of what happened in the 80s in the US between radical and “third world” feminists (think Audre Lorde): Meztisa feminists are making an identity political critique of radical feminism, saying that it carries with it all sorts of white-coded ideas. One example is that of cancelling (“scratching”), the idea that you can remove men from your community for having sexist beliefs, or because they have raped someone. This was common of student feminist groups while she studied at UNAM, and it is something which she and others have grown to be more critical of.

8. I am speaking in incredible generalities, as if “white US people” is a well defined and homogenous category. White experience is immense and multifaceted. My thoughts fail on so many different white communities. But I’m trying to explain part of white alienation which has been undeniable in my own life.

# Balance of Payment: a Euphemism
& 2020-6-11

When reading about the International Monetary Fund, I keep seeing that they helped countries with their "balance of payment" problems. Jon Williamson, in a lament for the phrase "Washington Consensus,"{1 "Did the Washington Consensus Fail?" An outline for a speech, dated 2002. https://www.piie.com/commentary/speeches-papers/did-washington-consensus-fail} which he coined, speaks of a "balance of payment crisis," and how dealing with this through "Fiscal Discipline" was ultimately good for a country's poor people. If you can pay attention long enough, it's easy to figure out that "balance of payment problem" just means that a country has run up a large deficit in its accounts. But why were so many countries having this problem? It was usually glossed over.

So I decided to look for the answer on Encyclopedia Britannica's website. This is from an informative article titled "Third World debt":

"" The origins of developing-world debt crisis can be traced to the oil-price shock of 1973–74. At the time, the member states of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) limited the supply of oil, which resulted in a huge increase in its price. That had a significant impact on all importers of oil, including many newly independent countries in Africa. The excess profits that OPEC members received were then invested in the Western commercial banking sector.{2 https://www.britannica.com/topic/Third-World-debt}

It seems like alot of money was flowing into private US banks. What next?

"" The banks then sought to find new borrowers to lend that money to. Developing countries, which were in need of development assistance to soften the impact of increased oil prices, were considered a sensible and safe option by the banks. That meant that during the second half of the 1970s, a significant proportion of the flows of capital to the developing world came from commercial banks. {3 Same, https://www.britannica.com/topic/Third-World-debt}

Ok, so private banks were making large and lucrative loans to these countries. So these are the guys that those countries, the ones with the "balance of payments crisis", owed money too. Well good thing they were private U.S. banks. The international financial system would probably understand if a private bank needed to make a sacrifice in case the country was having a really hard time paying it back.

"" The initial response to the developing-world debt crisis was an approach centred on short-term measures to prevent debt defaults. The IMF and the World Bank provided loans that were conditional on borrowing countries’ following a series of structural adjustment measures. Those were designed to increase the productivity of their economies in the hope that such increases would enable them to resolve their problems.{4 Same, https://www.britannica.com/topic/Third-World-debt}

Oh... so the IMF stepped in to... help... the country not default on a private loan. Well, ok, that's probably good, I guess maybe some creditors are better to deal with than others. But what's this thing about "structural adjustment measures"? The article doesn't have anything else on this, but there is a link to an article titled "Austerity" which might help:

"" During Argentina’s economic crisis in 1998–2002, the country adopted severe austerity measures, largely following the advice of its major creditor, the International Monetary Fund (IMF); they included cuts in government pensions and salaries and in numerous social programs, as well as significant tax increases. In return, the IMF agreed to extend a low-interest loan to the Argentine government to help its ailing economy.{5 https://www.britannica.com/topic/austerity}

Ok... that doesn't sound too great actually. Maybe I made a mistake following that link. "Austerity" sounds like a loaded word anyways. I'll just search the encyclopedia for "structural adjustment IMF," see what turns up.

"" In the late 1980s Egypt’s economy suffered markedly from falling oil prices and was further weakened by a drop in the number of remittances from its three million workers abroad. In spite of a rising debt burden, the government continued to rely heavily on foreign economic aid, leading to growing interference by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Egypt’s economic policies; in 1991 the Egyptian government signed the Economic Reform and Structural Adjustment Program with the IMF and the World Bank. The country’s currency, the Egyptian pound, had to be devalued several times, interest rates were raised, and subsidies were lowered on food and fuel. These policies especially harmed the poorest Egyptians, who often looked to Islamist groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood for assistance.{6 https://www.britannica.com/place/Egypt}

Huh.

"" Under pressure from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reverse the growth of government spending, liberalize prices, encourage a more open investment code, and provide incentives to agriculture and forestry, the Central African Republic submitted to a structural adjustment program in 1986.{7 https://www.britannica.com/place/Central-African-Republic/Economy}

Government spending, like education and medicine?

"" At first, international agencies such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, as well as Mobutu’s allies in the West, turned a blind eye to his personal appropriation of the economy and the associated declines in productivity and exports. The fall in copper prices in the mid-1970s, however, led to audits of state enterprises that revealed high levels of embezzlement. Nonetheless, Mobutu remained an important Cold War ally for Western countries, and for the next 20 years international financial institutions and his Western allies continued to find ways to keep the sinking economy afloat.{9 https://www.britannica.com/place/Democratic-Republic-of-the-Congo/Economy}

Wha-

"" The economy responded with a relentless decline. Exports fell, inflation rose, and debt was significantly expanded. Debt services took more than half of the country’s export earnings, and imports nearly ceased for lack of foreign exchange. ... Under these adverse conditions the country’s infrastructure and social services deteriorated greatly. The rural population was reduced to subsistence levels, bartering with cattle and bags of paddy. Bankrupt by 1982, the country was forced to adopt a program of structural adjustment imposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and face a humiliating turnabout to re-liberalize the economy. Abolition of the state monopolies was accepted, and any state enterprise that could not pay its way was threatened with privatization.{10 https://www.britannica.com/place/Madagascar}

Oh. 

Well, I'm glad I wasn't reading leftists, I would have learned nastier things.
