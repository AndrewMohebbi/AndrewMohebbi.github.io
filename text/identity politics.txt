# Different definitions of identity politics
& 8-10-2020

1. Something that social theorists were using, in the 20th century, to describe how politics played out in the US.

2. A term coined by the Combahee River Collective Statement to describe a certain model of organizing (previously picked up by other social theorists, like in 1.).

3. More broadly, the construction of revolutionary subjects, the type of person who will bring about the revolution. You see this in the Combahee statement, but also in feminism and in Marxism. For Marx, the revolutionary subject was the industrial worker.

3.1 This sometimes leads to absurdities, like the usurpers of the Russian revolution claiming that they should sieze power from the workers collectives because Russians are too parochial, agricultural, un-industrial to truly lead the revolution.

3.2 See A Cyborg Manifesto for discussion on the construction of revolutionary subjects. She tries to construct her own subject, the cyborg.

4. A description of a certain kind of discourse, much of which is found on social media. Involves making claims to what can or can’t be said or known depending on ones identity (heritage, race, gender, sexuality).

4.1 This is now part of mainstream US politics, since it has become part of the “culture wars,” maybe the broadest discursive space in US politics.
