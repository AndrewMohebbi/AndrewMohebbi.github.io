########## Cumin History
######### 2019-11-27
Likely originating in a region of the Eastern Mediterranean called the Levant,[9] cumin has been in use as a spice for thousands of years.[10] Seeds excavated at the Syrian site Tell ed-Der were dated to the second millennium BC.[citation needed] They have also been reported from several New Kingdom levels of ancient Egyptian archaeological sites.[9][11] In the ancient Egyptian civilization, cumin was used as a spice and as a preservative in mummification.[9][8]
Cumin was a significant spice for the Minoans in ancient Crete. Ideograms for cumin appear in Linear A archive tablets documenting Minoan palace stores during the Late Minoan period.
The ancient Greeks kept cumin at the dining table in its own container (much as pepper is frequently kept today), and this practice continues in Morocco. Cumin was also used heavily in ancient Roman cuisine. In India, it has been used for millennia as a traditional ingredient in innumerable recipes, and forms the basis of many other spice blends.
Cumin was introduced to the Americas by Spanish and Portuguese colonists. Several different types of cumin are known, but the most famous ones are black and green cumin, both of which are used in Persian cuisine.
Today, the plant is mostly grown in the Indian subcontinent, Northern Africa, Mexico, Chile, and China.[10] Since cumin is often used as part of birdseed and exported to many countries, the plant can occur as an introduced species in many territories.[13]
