# A Sympathetic Critique of Effective Altruism
$ TBD

An acquaintence of mine recently posted something like the following on Facebook: "I'm not going to donate to protest bail funds because I'd rather donate to a charity working in Africa which can deworm a child for a dollar, or distribute a mosquito net for fifty cents." It was the height of the anti-police riots, and he was talking about Effective Altruism (EA) organizations, charities which focused on delivering high dollar-to-impact ratio asistance to countries which lacked social program in some crucial areas. Low hanging fruit, like anti-malerial mosquito nets, which are incredibly cheap, and yet which were not getting distributed to areas of need.

I commented "I see your point, but don't forget that EA orgs wouldn't exist had the IMF not gutted African state programs!" He understood what I was saying, which was a slight surprise (I'll get to that later), although I shouldn't have expected anything less from him, someone I'd known to be an intelligent person. Although he received alot of criticism from others on that post,{1 Well, of course he did! He posted this at the height of the protests, when a very heated debate was happening on social media about police, racism and rioting. Practically anyone who criticized popular modes of action, including donating to bail funds and anti-police organizers, was sure to get shouted at by various people. Even property destruction was being vehemently defended by people who yesterday were only thinking about the national elections.} our conversation was short: he responded that he agreed with some slight reservations, I responded briefly saying I agree with his reservations, and it was over. But the whole thing left me thinking once more about EA and its political problems

## A thought experiment

In a nutshell, his reasoning was this: alot of money is required for bail.{2 How much? Not sure, a few hundred? Thousand?} By contrast, EA organizations were promising to literally save lives many times over for the same price.{3 If you're not familiar with EA organizations, their tendency to quanitfy human lives might rub you the wrong way.} He would rather donate his limited money to the EA organizations, where they can have a greater impact.

And I think this is pretty good reasoning. Certainly many people would agree with it. EA organizations are doing important, life saving work, finding niches where small amounts of money can go a long way. My only reservations are that this sort of logic, of quantifying good done for price payed, has some serious political limits.

Let's do a thought experiment, and make a gross charicature of this reasoning. Imagine that all donations where justified in this way: donate to the charities which can do the most for the least amount of effort. How can we figure out what is "the most good"? Let's make another gross reduction, and say, that saving lives, or saving people from permanent bodily damage, can be considered the best outcome an organization may boast of.

In this caricature, its easy to see that between bail funds and anti-malarial campaigns, the latter wins out, pretty much every time. Not only do bail funds normally not save lives, they are relatively expensive, given how cheaply mosquito nets can be manufactured. Given an endless amount of regions which are in dire need of anti-malarial nets, they would suck up all the donations which would go to the bail funds, by the logic we established. Actually, in this logic, EA orgs would probably suck up most of the charitable donations anyone makes anywhere, since the needs they service are often so basic yet so dire.{4 At this point you might be wondering "What if i donate to police abolition organizers, and they successfully abolish their city's police? Surely that would save many lives." And I agree with this. Although if we want to keep the thought experiment as absurd as I intend it, we also have to require our organizations to provide a plausible lives-saved numbers, and I think at this point, given how entrenched policing is in the modern U.S. state, I don't think it's reasonable to expect that we can expect an organization to single handedly abolish police in a city. Why would the city bureaucracies give it up? How would they provide the force that their businesses need to maintain their property rights, and their commodity prices? Wouldn't there be a huge surge in private policing, bringing us closer to the anarcho-capitalist dystopia we see in so many memes?}

Absurd as this thought experiment is, I think there are people in the EA movement that approximate it.{5 The main inspiration for this thought experiment is Peter Singer, and his knack for, in keeping with the tradtion of western philosophy, absurdly reductivist thought experiments which still manage to seduce you. I certainly was, when I was younger. His favorite in the context of EA is that of a child who is drowning in a lake you happen to be walking by. certainly, he argues, you are obligated to go in and rescue the child, no matter what inconvenience it would cause, because soiling your clothes cannot compare to the wrong of letting the child die. Which of course is analogous to donating trifling sums of money to EA organizations, who can save a life with it. I Actually like this analogy, but disability-activists have long pointed out the ablist thought experiments he makes in his work on animal rights and people with disabilities. See, for example, Sunaura Taylor's "Beasts of Burden," one of my favorite books on the politics of animals for the illuminating connections it draws between ableism and the consumption of animals.} But I'm thankful that most people would not be so reductive that they would think in this way. For the record, I'm glad EA organizations exist. I believe that affluent people should donate a portion of their income towards these important, life-saving programs. It's just that there are some obvious and disturbing problems when we start approximating, in the real world, the logic of this thought experiment.

## The problem of politics
You've probably notice the problem with this logic, which is that politics are missing. Actually, it might strike you as creepy how devoid of politics the world we constructed is.

-to start off with: why arent we donating to political causes? material support is important
-second, why are these probelsm with mosquitos? dont states normally do things for this?

## Let me tell you about IMF structural adjustment
-Let's talk about the IMF?

## But do EA people actually think this way?
Let me tell you a short story. Once, a couple of my friends and I bussed to an EA meetup in Cambridge.{a Boston Cambridge, not Cambridge Cambridge} It was a small apartment, packed with people, mostly in their 20s and 30s, with a delightful vegan meal beign served. The guests of honor was some young philosopher from Oxford{b Actually, I remember that Oxford was a hotspot for EA, and that some of the people that were most developing the philosophy were young, students of philosophy in their 20s. This in itself is an ethical issue, especially when you consider that alot fo EA activity went towards convincing people that they should plan a career which had a high philanthropic impact. Actually, one of the recommendations, made by organizations such as  the 80,000 Hours, was "Earn to Give," meaning taking a career that payed highly in order to give it to high-impact EA groups working in impoverished areas. A common Earn to Give job was investment banker. A younger me would have said that this recommendation epitomized the apolitical tendencies of EA, in that it took real wealth created by workers, stolen by Wall Street, only to hand it off to vigilante charities filling the gaping holes left by the IMF in, say, the Zambian welfare state. Today I'm sceptical of this crude Marxist, labor-value interpreatation of finance, and it truly feels closer to Robin Hood politics, since, as the 2008 crisis taught us, Wall Street wealth is almost all made up. Anyways, getting back to what I was saying: why the hell are 20-something year olds, philosophy PhDs no less, telling people what careers they should take? The arrogance is astounding.} who had been going around, helping set up these local EA groups, and doing some EA philosophizing himself.{c That is, he engaged in actual EA work but also evangelized it.} Some of the topics i chatted about with people: what jobs should one take for high-impact work? what was the risk of AIs destroying humanity? How much should we pay attention to existential dangers in the deep future? And of course, what charities were best to donate to? When my friends and I left, we all felt like something was off, and we put our finger on it right away: this was morality without politics. 

Or maybe it was morality as politics. Either way, it was a totalizing conception of morality, one highly influenced both by the western ethical tradition, especially utilitarian reformists like Jeremy Bentham, and by western state-bureaucratic methods of quantifying populations and social programs; because of this, it conveniently elided all questions of actual political struggle, of change, substituting in its place endless bureaucratic tweaking. In other words, it was the product of a peculiar poltical class, the progressive western bureaucrat, where the questions of politics were either already solved, or pending solution by state program. With a neocolonial twist: it was NGOs in the west which would decide how social safety nets in Africa would be constructed.

I don't want to claim that all EA people have this impoverished conception of politics, but I do want to warn you, and make this critique, which I have had to piece together as I slowly came to understand what EA is. Certainly my Facebook interlocutor understood where my critique was coming from, and agreed with it. But we have popular figure heads like Peter Singer who write entire books{aa "The Life You Can Save: Acting Now to End World Poverty". Actually, doesn't the title kind of give you the creeps? It oozes this highly individualistic, marketing jargon energy that makes me want to play video games and forget that I live in a society.} without mentioning the IMF, or structural adjustment, or really asking why NGOs are increasingly filling the roles which states have been forced, by international bureaucracies, to stop providing. And again, I can't say that all EA writers are like this; I haven't even read most of them. But I'm warning you about this tendency I've seen in the EA movement which needs to be talked about.

If you're interested in EA, good. But please don't let it be an end to your politics. 



To Do:
-put in something about teh animal rights stuff and that one podcast you listeend to with the chickens and such
-verify about The Life you Can Save
-put some alternatives: maybe EA can focus on convincing the IMF to stop fucking doing it, and pay reparations. or maybe EA can turn into an org for riot praxis. Looting to fight looting. Obviously super effective
-in the Problem of Politics, put in how it perpetuates this myth that african countries are backwards
