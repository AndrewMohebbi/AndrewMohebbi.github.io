        <p>Cumin (/ˈkʌmɪn/,[2][3] /ˈkjuːmɪn/,[2][3] or US: /ˈkuːmɪn/)[2] (Cuminum cyminum) is a flowering plant in the family Apiaceae, native to southwestern Asia including the Middle East.[4] Its seeds – each one contained within a fruit, which is dried – are used in the cuisines of many cultures in both whole and ground form. Although cumin is thought to have uses in traditional medicine, there is no high-quality evidence that it is safe or effective as a therapeutic agent.[5] </p>
